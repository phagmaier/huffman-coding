Never wrote huffman in c++ wanted to try it.
Also I know you can use a lambda function for the built 
in sort in c++ but i decided to write my own although in 
defaultsorting.cpp I use the sorting algo in the algorithm
library

IDK Why i'm writting this no one will read it not even me.
If you are find a better way to spend your day
